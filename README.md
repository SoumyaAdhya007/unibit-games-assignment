Given an array of integers and a target value, you must determine which two integers' sum
equals the target and return a 2D array. Then merge the array into a single array with sorting (
ascending ) order, in the next step double the target value and find again the combination of
digits (can be multiple digits ) that are equal to the double targeted value and returned into a 2D
array.
Sample Input : [1, 3, 2, 2, -4, -6, -2, 8];
Target Value = 4,
Output: First Combination For “4” : [ [1,3],[2,2],[-4,8],[-6,2] ];
Merge Into a single Array : [-6,-4,1,2,2,2,3,8];
Second Combination For “8” : [ [ 1,3,2,2], [8,-4,2,2],....,[n,n,n,n] ]

Step 1: Finding pairs that sum up to the target value

Given an array of integers and a target value, the first step is to determine which two integers' sum equals the target. In this case, the target value is 4.

Here's how you can find the pairs:

Iterate through the array and consider each element.
For each element, iterate through the remaining elements to find a pair that sums up to the target.
If a pair is found, store it in a 2D array.
For the given input [1, 3, 2, 2, -4, -6, -2, 8] and target value 4, here are the pairs that sum up to 4:

[1, 3]
[2, 2]
[-4, 8]
[-6, 2]
So the output of this step is a 2D array: [[1, 3], [2, 2], [-4, 8], [-6, 2]].

Step 2: Merge the array into a single array in ascending order

The next step is to merge all the pairs into a single array and sort it in ascending order.

Taking the pairs from the previous step: [[1, 3], [2, 2], [-4, 8], [-6, 2]], we can merge them into a single array: [-6, -4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8]. Sorting this array in ascending order gives: [-6, -4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8].

Step 3: Double the target value and find combinations equal to the double target

In this step, you need to double the target value (which was 4) to get 8. Then, you need to find combinations of digits (which can be multiple digits) in the merged array from the previous step that are equal to 8.

Here's how you can find the combinations:

Iterate through the merged array and consider each element.
For each element, iterate through the remaining elements to find combinations that sum up to the double target.
If a combination is found, store it in a 2D array.
For the merged array [-6, -4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8] and double target value 8, here's an example of a combination that sums up to 8: [1, 3, 2, 2].

So the output of this step is a 2D array: [[1, 3, 2, 2], [8, -4, 2, 2], [8, 1, 2, 3], [8, 2, 2, 2], ... [n, n, n, n]] (where [n, n, n, n] represents any combination of elements that sums up to 8).

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
